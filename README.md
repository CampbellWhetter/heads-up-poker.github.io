Thank you for visiting Heads-Up Poker, an action-packed game that will keep you hooked with its interactive and fresh gameplay.

## How to Play
Heads-Up Poker has all the essential elements of traditional Texas Hold’Em. To begin, press the ‘Start’ button. This will display the table, your cards, the computer’s cards, face down, and options to 
fold, check, call, or raise, depending on the situation. Once you are familiarized with the game and your cards, click one of the buttons at the bottom of the screen to submit your action. After this, 
either the flop cards will be displayed, or the computer will take its turn. When this is finished, the computer will alert you that it is your turn. The rest of the game will follow a similar structure 
and will be intuitive, making it easy to follow.
	
 As a personal touch to the game, I made a couple of slight changes to the rules. Most importantly, the user and computer are not able to raise to an amount greater than either one of their chip stacks. 
 In other words, the user and computer will be able to call each other’s raise every time. This maintains the integrity of the game while making the gameplay and code more efficient. Second, if there is a 
 tie and the pot has an odd amount of chips, the extra chip will go to the big blind. This adds a little more merit to being the big blind. Ultimately, the game figures to be entertaining and consistently 
 enjoyable, which is complemented by my personal touches.
